$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \ne 0$.

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
[remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).

These features do not work by default.
ðŸ‘† Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
| GFM        | 100% w/ remark-gfm |
